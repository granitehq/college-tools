## Important Notes

1. **Current Scope Status**: Your scopes are non-sensitive, so OAuth verification is not required unless you:
   - Plan to have 100+ users
   - Want to list publicly on Marketplace

2. **API Key Management**: Current setup requires users to provide their own API key, which is good for:
   - Avoiding rate limits
   - Reducing liability
   - Simplifying compliance

3. **Free vs Paid**: As a free add-on, you have fewer compliance requirements but still need:
   - Privacy policy
   - Terms of service
   - Support contact

4. **Testing Recommendation**: Before submitting, test with at least 5-10 different users to ensure stability
