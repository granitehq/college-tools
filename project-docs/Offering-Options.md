Additional Requirements for Approval

  Based on the checklist and research, you're mostly covered, but here are a few additional things to consider:

  1. Testing Requirements

  - Create test documentation showing the add-on works properly
  - Test error scenarios (invalid API key, network failures, rate limits)
  - Multi-user testing - Have 5-10 people test it before submission

  2. User Experience Polish

  - Loading indicators - Show progress when fetching data from API
  - Clear error messages - User-friendly explanations when things fail
  - Help/instructions - You already have the Instructions sheet, which is good

  3. API Key Setup Flow

  - Your current "Quick Start" flow is good
  - Consider adding a test button to verify the API key works

  4. Security Best Practices

  - Never log sensitive data to console
  - Validate all user inputs
  - Handle API errors gracefully

  Distribution Outside Google Marketplace

  Yes, you can absolutely distribute outside the Marketplace! Here are your options:

  Option 1: GitHub Distribution (Recommended)

  ✅ Completely allowed - No Google terms violation
  ## How users would install:
  1. User gets your spreadsheet template
  2. They go to Extensions → Apps Script
  3. They see your code (already bound to the sheet)
  4. It just works!

  Benefits:
  - No approval process needed
  - Instant updates
  - Full control
  - Free hosting
  - Open source community

  Distribution methods:
  - Share template spreadsheet with "Make a copy" link
  - Your current setup: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_DI-6_f1jTyqL3QKcWsuyRmgHFjnc6rhkp7Oqz6QqpU/copy

  Option 2: Direct Sharing

  - Share the Google Sheet template directly
  - Users make a copy
  - Script comes with the copy
  - This is what you're already doing!

  Option 3: Hybrid Approach

  - Distribute via GitHub for developers
  - Submit to Marketplace for broader reach
  - Maintain both channels

  Important Clarifications

  Google's Terms - What's Allowed:

  1. ✅ Bound scripts (like yours) can be freely shared with the spreadsheet
  2. ✅ Template sharing is explicitly encouraged by Google
  3. ✅ Open source distribution is fully supported
  4. ✅ No OAuth verification needed for template distribution (users < 100)

  What Would Violate Terms:

  1. ❌ Misleading users about Google affiliation
  2. ❌ Bypassing security warnings without user consent
  3. ❌ Accessing data beyond declared scopes
  4. ❌ Selling it as "official Google" product

  Recommended Distribution Strategy

  Since you're already set up well, here's what I recommend:

  Phase 1: GitHub/Direct (Immediate)

  - Keep sharing your template link
  - Host docs on GitHub Pages
  - No approval needed
  - Start building user base

  Phase 2: Marketplace (Optional, Later)

  Only if you want broader reach:
  - Submit when you have proven stability
  - After getting user feedback
  - When you have time for the review process

  Final Compliance Check

  For GitHub/template distribution, you only need:
  - ✅ Privacy Policy (for transparency)
  - ✅ Terms of Service (for protection)
  - ✅ Clear instructions
  - ✅ Proper OAuth scopes in manifest

  For Marketplace, additionally:
  - Logo and screenshots
  - Hosted privacy/terms URLs
  - Review process (1-3 weeks)
  - Ongoing support commitment

  Your Current Status

  You're already 100% compliant for GitHub/template distribution!

  The files we created (privacy, terms, checklist) are primarily for:
  1. Professional appearance
  2. Legal protection
  3. Future Marketplace submission (if desired)

  You can continue distributing via your template link immediately without any Google approval needed. The Marketplace is just an optional additional
  distribution channel.
